How to get iTunes item ID's:

1. Get the iTunes URL... From iTunes Mac/PC: Copy URL links from the iTunes Store from within iTunes Mac/PC. Right click an item and you have a "Copy URL" option. Without using iTunes, search for items using: https://linkmaker.itunes.apple.com/

2. Extract the ID from the URL... Once you have the URL, the ID is the digits after "id" in the URL.
