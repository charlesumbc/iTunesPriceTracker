### How to get iTunes item ID's:
----------------------------

1. **Get the iTunes URL:** In iTunes Mac/PC, copy URL links from the iTunes Store from within iTunes Mac/PC. Right click an item and you have a "Copy URL" option. If you don't want to use iTunes, search for items using: https://linkmaker.itunes.apple.com/ and get the URL from the results.

2. **Extract the ID from the URL:** Once you have the URL, the ID is the digits after "id" in the URL.
